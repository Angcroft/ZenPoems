# ZenPoems: Random Haiku Generator (RHG)

## Introduction

ZenPoems is a command-line application written in Python for generating a Haiku from words extracted of the corpus available on NLTK. This project aims to provide a kinda fun example for generating the haiku following the basic rules of it (the 5,7,5 syllable rule mostly), and learning some of the features of Python programming concepts related with some new perks.

## Features

* Generate a haiku from completely random words available with NLTK.
* User-friendly command-line interface (CLI).

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
* **zenmenu.py**: Contains the CLI menu content and the results of generating the haiku.
* **zenpoems.py**: Here we have everything needed for making the poems.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

```sh
https://github.com/Angcroft/ZenPoems.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd ZenPoems
```

## How it works

When you run the program, you'll be presented with a simple menu where there's only two options.

### Main Menu Options
1. Generate a random Haiku
2. Exit the program

### Generate the Haiku

The Haiku is completely random, and doesn't have a way to modify which words go and which doesn't.
